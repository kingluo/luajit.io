# luajit.io

## Introduction

**Pure Lua IO framework, with C efficiency due to its simple but powerful design, and, of course, thanks to luajit, the perfect JIT engine. The HTTP Server is out-of-the-box, which simulates the functionalities and performance of nginx and ngx_lua. Moreover, it could be used to develop generic TCP/UDP server.**

Why reinvent the wheel? Well, the nginx and ngx_lua is renowned at efficiency and extensible, but they are written in C language, so you need to be as smart as the authors to contribute codes. What if the core is written in pure lua language, but without any efficiency tradeoff? Then not only the web apps are extensible, but also the server core is extensible at ease by any levels of developers!

The Luajit is a perfect JIT engine to improve lua performance, so with dedicated and luajit-oriented design, the luajit.io would reassemble the advantages of nginx and ngx_lua, but provides extra benefit: simple and extensible at the core.

**See the http://luajit.io for demo.**

## API compatible with ngx_lua (Work In Progress)

It provides seamless ngx_lua API, so third-party openresty libraries could be used in luajit.io without porting.

Tested libraries:

* lua-resty-lock
* lua-resty-upload
* lua-resty-http
* lua-resty-dns
* lua-resty-redis
* lua-resty-mysql
* lua-resty-postgres

## Supported Platforms

**Only supports Linux on x86 or x64.**

The luajit.io uses linux-specific features, e.g. epoll, signalfd, timerfd, inotify, etc.

## Dependencies

* openssl
* zlib
* pcre

On Debian Linux, you should install the dev packages of them, which contains the required *.so links:

``` shell
apt-get install zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libpcre3-dev
```

On Centos Linux:

``` shell
yum install zlib-devel pcre-devel openssl-devel
```

## Status

This library is considered experimental and still under active development.

And there is still big room to improve the performance, by increasing the jit compiled ratio, which is really a tough job.

Welcome to join and help!

## QuickStart

### install luajit

```
wget https://luajit.org/download/LuaJIT-2.1.0-beta3.zip
unzip LuaJIT-2.1.0-beta3.zip
cd LuaJIT-2.1.0-beta3
make install
ln -sf luajit-2.1.0-beta3 /usr/local/bin/luajit
```

### http server

Just like the API compatibility, the luajit.io configuration simulates the nginx.conf, so most directives are copied from there.
See conf/httpd.lua for example.

Copy the example into new file, e.g. conf/myhttpd.lua, and adjust the content according to your need.

Then just run it:

``` shell
luajit conf/myhttpd.lua
```

### generic tcp server

It contains a simple socks5 server, as the generic tcp server demo.

``` shell
LD_PRELOAD=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 luajit conf/socks5.lua
```

Note that by default, the luajit is not compiled with `-lpthread`, which would cause multi-threading usage crash.

See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10652 for detail.

The async DNS resolving uses multi-threading, so either re-compile the luajit or use LD_PRELOAD before running it.

You should locate the correct version of libpthread.so on your box.

``` shell
locate libpthread.so
```
